## 🚀 About Me
I’m an Informatics (Data Science) student at **The University of Texas at Austin**, passionate about building intelligent systems that sit at the intersection of **machine learning, analytics, product engineering, and real-world impact**.

My journey spans San Jose → Bangalore → Dallas → Seoul → Austin, where I've designed ML systems for **semiconductor manufacturing**, built predictive models for **crypto markets**, engineered **LLM-powered auditing tools**, and contributed to full-stack product development used by real customers.

I love solving messy, ambiguous problems — turning data into decisions, and ideas into production-ready systems. Friendly people, good conversations, and ambitious teams are what motivate me most.

## ✨ What I’m Doing Right Now

### 💼 **Software Developement @ Revphlo**
Working on the full Revphlo analytics platform — building features across backend, data systems, and intelligent retrieval engines that help sales teams understand their pipelines in real time.  
Some highlights:
- Developing scalable features across the product stack, from data modeling to customer-facing intelligence.
- Expanding the semantic retrieval pipelines powering sales insights.
- Building internal tooling that helps sales teams automate KPI reporting and surface meaningful trends.

### 📊 **Data Science & AI Work**
Across semiconductor research, blockchain analytics, and ML systems engineering, I’ve gained hands-on experience applying machine learning at scale in high-impact domains. A few core areas:
- Time-series forecasting  
- Clustering & rare-event modeling  
- NLP + RAG systems  
- Deep learning & predictive modeling
